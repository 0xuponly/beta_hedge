# beta_hedge
This script allows you to hedge the beta of your portfolio relative to a benchmark while maintaining alpha, allowing for the removal of the part of returns driven by the market and leaving only the returns driven by the desired factors. 
The script will pull data for a stock and a benchmark, calculate the alpha returned by the stock and its beta to the benchmark, then hedge the beta.
Substituting the stock's daily returns for your portfolio's daily returns would make for a more realistic exercise, however for the purposes of this script, daily return data for $CVNA is used along with $QQQ returns as the benchmark.
When running the script, returns of the stock & the benchmark will first be plotted and the alpha & beta will be printed in the terminal, next returns of the stock and the benchmark along with a regression line will be plotted, and finally returns of the beta-hedged stock & the benchmark will be plotted and the resulting alpha & beta will be printed in the terminal.
You will notice that while the alpha returned both before and after hedging remain essentially the same, the beta is reduced drastically. A resulting beta of (or very near) zero indicates fully hedged.
